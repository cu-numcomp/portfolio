# CSCI-3656 Journal: YOUR NAME

Please spend a few minutes roughly once a week to think about your goals, challenges, successes, and adaptations.
This can be a sort of notes from talking with your partner, or can be written independently.

* How are lecture and activities going?
* How are you progressing toward your goals?
    * Do you want to revise your goals?
* What setbacks have you encountered?
    * To what do you attribute those setbacks?
    * How are you coping?

While chatting with your partner, try to identify questions that you'd like to ask.
Will you ask those in Zulip, in office hours, during class, or some other way?
